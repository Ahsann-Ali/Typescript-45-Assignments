// Assignment # 42
// Great Magicians: Start with a copy of your program from Exercise 41. 
// Write a function called make_great() that modifies the array of magicians by adding the phrase the Great to each magicianâ€™s name. 
// Call show_magicians() to see that the list has actually been modified.


let magician: string[] = ["Harry Potter", "Hermione", "Dumbledor"];

function make_great(great: string[]) {
  for (let index = 0; index < great.length; index++) {
    magician[index] = "the Great " + great[index];
  }

function show_magicians(Magicians: string[]) {
  Magicians.forEach((element) => {
    console.log(element);
